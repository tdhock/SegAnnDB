Add support for browsers that do not render large PNG images. SegAnnDB
currently uses very large PNGs to visualize DNA copy number profiles,
but these are not supported by all browsers.
http://sugiyama-www.cs.titech.ac.jp/~toby/images/ One way to fix this
problem would be to always assume that the maximum pixel width is 1500
(the current size for "standard" whole chromosome display, and for
whole profile display). On the chromosome page, e.g.
http://bioviz.rocq.inria.fr/profile/dr3hg19/2/ we could delete the
"Plot size" links. Instead we would provide links at the top to
various sub-regions of chromosomes, like we have chromosome links on
the top of http://bioviz.rocq.inria.fr/profile/dr3hg19/ The links
would be
e.g. http://bioviz.rocq.inria.fr/profile/dr3hg19/2/1000000:2000000/
and those pages would contain 1500 x 200 pixel images, and provide
links to the areas before and after on that same chromosome.

Social features for sharing annotations. SegAnnDB currently lets a
user login using Mozilla Persona and then add user-specific annotated
region labels. These annotations are currently only accessible to the
user that creates them, but it would be nice to be able to share them
with others. For example, Alice annotates some data then types the
email address of her friend Bob into a web form. Bob then receives an
email with a web link where he can view Alice's annoatations.

Faster deletion. SegAnnDB uses BerkeleyDB, which is very fast but
makes updating and deleting profiles a bit tricky. I have started
writing a view (plotter.views.delete_profiles) for profile deletion
along with some database support (plotter.db.Profile.delete), but it
is a slow O(ND) operation where T is the number of databases and N is
the average number of items in each database. Deleting one profile
should be an O(1) operation.

BerkeleyDB accumulates log files which must be periodically deleted,
and we should have a daemon that does this...
http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/doc/BerkeleyDB/ref/transapp/logfile.html

Unit tests using Pyramid recommendations, for example when a profile
is processed (plotter.db.Profile.process) test for presence of objects
in the database, and then when the profile is deleted, check for
deletion of relvant objects and files (PNG scatterplots,
probes.bedGraph.gz data).

Integration with Galaxy? From within Galaxy, is it possible to store
the annotated regions in a database and display an updated
segmentation model?

In practice the process daemon can be inactive when there are still
un-processed profiles. When the process daemon is idle it should check
the list of profiles and add un-processed profiles back into the
ProfileQueue.
